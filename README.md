- 👋 Hi, I’m The9Coon
- 👀 Welcome to my Github profile, where the automotive world meets my savage hacking skills and my twisted sense of humor. I'm an Automotive hacker and CyberSecurity Engineer with significant years of experience in the field, and I'm not your average cybersecurity expert.

I'll hack into any car, truck, or vehicle that I can get my hands on, and I'll do it with a devilish grin on my face. But don't worry, I'm not out to cause chaos - I'm just here to expose the vulnerabilities that others overlook.

When it comes to automotive systems, I know all the tricks. I can reverse engineer firmware, sniff out communication protocols, and bypass any security measure you throw my way. And if you're foolish enough to try to hack my code, well, let's just say you better bring your A-game.

But it's not all serious business - I believe that humor is an essential part of life, even when it comes to cybersecurity. So don't be surprised if you find some hilarious memes and sarcastic comments sprinkled throughout my projects.

On my Github profile, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my technical skills and my devil-may-care attitude. I don't play by the rules - I make my own. And if you're brave enough to collaborate with me, we might just create something legendary.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project or if you just want to exchange some witty banter. Let's keep the automotive cybersecurity world both savage and ridiculous.
